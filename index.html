                My first instrument that I learned was the piano, but my heart lies with the viola. Its greatest strength is its rich, dark tone that especially shines in solo playing.

                My favorite media genre is Sci-Fi. I believe well made fiction should contain immersive worlds, even if it is at the expense of the plot.

                Last but not least, learning how to read and write Mandarin is another pastime time that I enjoy. I was born in California and my family moved to Texas when I was still young.  I'm a bit embarassed to admit that I still don't know how to write in Mandarin despite growing up with parents who mostly spoke in Mandarin.
