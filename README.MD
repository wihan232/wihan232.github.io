| This project lays out the first steps of the process of creating a fully functional webpage. By building the skeleton of the webpage out of HTML, it advances our knowledge of the foundations of a webpage. Later in this course, we will learn how to apply the CSS language along with JavaScript to make our webpage interactive. We will demonstrate our abilty to apply project managing principles by applying scoping in the form of a Scope.md. The Scope.md acts as a documentation for the index.html. |

| The index.html will be written in **HTML** in **VS Code** and contain: <br>1. A `title` element and a `head` element<br>2. A main heading `H1` with my name, _William Han_<br>3. A subheading `H2` for my major, _Computing Applications_<br>4. Two paragraphs `P` describing my **career** and **course** goals.<br>5. An unordered list `u1` with **3** list elements `li` specifying my hobbies<br>6. A hyperlink `a` to my Github (https://github.com/wihan232/)<br>                                          |

| The index.html will function as a standalone temporary webpage. When clicked, it will open up a file from our file directory in our web browser. The webpage will display the elements that were specified in the description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
